# zephyr_network
On barnowl, change the format of your zephyrs to short form using the command
:o
Then, run 
:dump zephyrs.txt
in the same directory as this python file. Then run the python file and the graph should pop up.

In order for this to work, you need to have networkx and matplotlib installed.
